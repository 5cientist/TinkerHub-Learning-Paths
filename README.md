## Why is python an excellent option for data analysis :question: :thinking:
1. **Easy to learn**

...Python is focused on simplicity as well as readability, providing a host of helpful options for data analysts/scientists simultaneously. Thus, newbies can easily utilize its pretty simple syntax to build effective solutions even for complex scenarios.
2. **Well-supported**

...Being in widespread use in industrial alongside academic areas, Python has a broad array of helpful libraries with tons of helpful and support materials. The great benefit is that all the libraries are available at no cost.
