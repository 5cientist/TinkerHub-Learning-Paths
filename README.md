# Data Analysis :chart: using Python :snake:

A learning path for learning data analysis using python curated by ![shaji-stark](https://github.com/shaji-stark)

## Why is python an excellent option for data analysis :question: :thinking:
1. **Easy to learn**

    Python is focused on simplicity as well as readability, providing a host of helpful options for data analysts/scientists simultaneously. Thus, newbies can easily utilize its pretty simple syntax to build effective solutions even for complex scenarios.

2. **Well-supported**

    Being in widespread use in industrial alongside academic areas, Python has a broad array of helpful libraries with tons of helpful and support materials. The great benefit is that all the libraries are available at no cost.

3. **Graphics and Visualization Tools**

    You can make the data more accessible and easier-to-use by means of creating various charts and graphics, as well as web-ready interactive plots. Yes, Python provides you with the capability to get a good sense of data.

4. **Extended packs of analytics tools available**

    Straight after you gather data, you’re to handle it. Python suits this purpose supremely well. So, seeking for the perfect tool for complex data processing or self-service analytics, we can’t but mention Python’s built-in data analytics tools.

## Future and scope of the field

    As companies are becoming more tech-driven and fast-paced now,   data analysis professional are already playing an increasingly crucial role in businesses. Both startups and tech giants in India are adding data analysts to their workforce who are able of recording, analyzing and dissecting data to drive efficient decision-making.
