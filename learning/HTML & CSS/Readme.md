Learning path for HTML & CSS curated by [Vighnesh](https://github.com/aka8921/):bowtie:

## Why learn HTML & CSS :question:

HTML & CSS is the backbone of layout & designing of web pages. Whatever you *SEE* in a web browser is basically HTML and CSS. Add some JavaScript with it and you'll have a pretty decent web app.

Here we will be focusing on the fundamental concepts of HTML & CSS without any frameworks. You might / might not be interested in creating a webpage layout in HTML & CSS from scratch depending on who you are. But it's always an advantage if you know some of the most important CSS concepts like Flexbox, Grid, Positioning etc., especially when you are pursuing Front End Web development.

Obviously, This path can't be considered as the full fledged Front End Web Development path in anyway. Layouting is just one part of the equation and you should learn some JavaScript ( And preferabily a JS framework ). Now, before spending your time on javascript, You should be capable of understanding basic layouting techniques in HTML and CSS. We'll leave the Front End Web Development path's link at the end of this path :wink:
