## Programming Knowledge 

Programming knowledge is a must obviously.

### Learn Python,PHP,JS,HTML&CSS :rocket:

1. Basic knowledge about HTML,CSS&JS is must.
2. Learn any server side language like Python,PHP or Ruby.
3. If you want to code your own exploits, learn C.

:bulb: The python book [Learn python3: the hardway](https://www.amazon.in/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0134692888) is a good resource.


### Install and setup stuffs :construction:

Things you need and need not.

1. A :computer: running any linux based OS (You can also use windows, but it sucks.)
2. A :brain: to think.
3. Kali linux :x:, even ubuntu will do the work.
4. Problem solving skills.
5. Investigation oriented mind :white_check_mark:


#### :full_moon_with_face: Only do this if you have plans to learn. First learn, then earn. There will be some time you may find yourself lost.
